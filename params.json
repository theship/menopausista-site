Feeling overwhelmed and underserved, we've decided to take matters in our own hands. And we'd like you to join.\r\n\r\nHave you had it with menopause? Are you affected hour-by-hour -- if not minute-by-minute? Interesting studies are coming out daily, but practical knowledge is weak. Popular sites on the internet provide vacuous or contradictory information. Healthcare professionals try to be clinical researchers, holistic healers, and life coaches. \r\n\r\nLet's take charge of our menopause. Let's share our stories and commiserate. But also, let's use the power of the internet to gather and analyze data.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nHedy, Mimi, Julee (@theship)\r\n\r\n### Who are you?\r\nWe're currently looking for folks who want to share their story, do research, design a study database, and design a survey. \r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nFeel free to contact us through Julee (@theship) until we get the site up.",
